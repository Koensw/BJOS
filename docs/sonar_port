integrate helpers/SonarReader in SonarController
make a DevantechSonarController and a SonarController
let the DevantechSonarController be intern (prefixed with a _) and let the applications uses SonarController that acts as abstraction layer (and let it support various sort of controllers)
start a thread in the SonarController to read and write to the sonars
let the SonarController load all its supported controllers
specify the amount of sonars statically before compiling so we can easier share the data
SonarInfo

- address
- position
- orientation
SharedSonarControllerData{
    static SonarInfo array
    int array_size
    
    double update_time
    static char / int sonar_type_id (devantech / maxbotix)
}

add a BJOSSonarInterface to the active safety layer
give each sonar a specific ID so the interface can read that specific sonar
save the sonar position in the controller


*** SUPPORT A LOADING STATE IN BJOS FOR THE LOADER TO COMPLETE ***
